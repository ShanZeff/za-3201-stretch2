# Testing

The primary testing framework being used within *stretch_ros* is pytest. Pytest is an open source testing framework that scales well and takes a functional approach resulting in minimal boiler plate code. First we should ensure that pytest is installed and up to date:


```bash
>>$ pip3 install -U pytest
>>$ pytest --version
pytest 6.2.4
```
